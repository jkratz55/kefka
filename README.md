# Kefka

Kefka is a simple library that wraps the official Confluent Go Kafka library. My motivation for creating this library came from working with so many code bases that needed to either consume and/or produce messages from/to Kafka. I found myself writing a lot of the same code over and over and decided to move it into an open source library. Hopefully other people find it useful.

Kefka is named after Kefka Palazzo, the main antagonist of the critically acclaimed video game Final Fantasy VI.
